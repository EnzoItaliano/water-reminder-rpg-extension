# Privacy Policy for HydroQuest 🛡️
**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

Your privacy is important to us. **HydroQuest** is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. This policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
HydroQuest is a self-contained extension. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.

The following data is collected and stored locally on your device to enable the game's core features:

- **Hydration Data:** Your water goals, the amount of water you log, and the timestamps of your drinks are stored to calculate your progress and enforce healthy drink intervals.

- **RPG Progress:** Your level, gold, unlocked monsters, and trophy history are stored to maintain your game state.

- **Settings:** Your preferences (such as notification settings) are saved to personalize your experience.

## 2. Storage
All data is stored using the ```chrome.storage.local``` API. This means your data remains on your computer and is never uploaded to a cloud or shared with third parties. If you uninstall the extension, this local data is typically removed by the browser.

## 3. Permissions
HydroQuest requests the following permissions to function:

- ```storage```: Used to save your hydration goals and game progress locally.

- ```alarms```: Used to manage your session timers and schedule hydration reminders.

- ```notifications```: Used to send you alerts for drink reminders and battle results.

## 4. Third-Party Access
Because HydroQuest does not use any external APIs or servers, no third parties have access to your data through this extension.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
As HydroQuest evolves, this policy may be updated. Any changes will be reflected in this document.

**Contact** If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please open an issue in the project's GitHub repository.
